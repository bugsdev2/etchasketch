# etchasketch

This is my attempt at making an etch-a-sketch. This really feels like being dropped in the deeper part of the learning ocean (as was expected from TOP). I'm excited. Let's see how it goes. This time, I'll focus on doing things a but more structurally. I'll update my reflections in the bottom after the completion of this project.
